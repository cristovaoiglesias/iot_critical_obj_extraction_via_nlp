This model has BERT as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. Named entity recognition is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for.\n","\n","This tutorial uses the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on 2 tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.\n","\n","If you want to know more about BERT, I suggest the following resources:\n","* the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\n","* Jay Allamar's [blog post](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) as well as his [tutorial](http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)\n","* Chris Mccormick's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRX98PLOsaN8PtekB9kWrw)\n","* Abbishek Kumar Mishra's [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/abhisheksvnit)\n","\n","The following notebook largely follows the same structure as the tutorials by Abhishek Kumar Mishra. For his tutorials on the Transformers library, see his [Github repository](https://github.com/abhimishra91/transformers-tutorials).\n","\n","NOTE: this notebook assumes basic knowledge about deep learning, BERT, and native PyTorch. If you want to learn more Python, deep learning and PyTorch, I highly recommend cs231n by Stanford University and the FastAI course by Jeremy Howard et al.

the data**\n","Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging))**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word. \n","\n","Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like \"Barack Obama was born in Hawaï\", then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. B-PERS means that the word \"Barack\" is the beginning of a person, I-PERS means that the word \"Obama\" is inside a person, \"O\" means that the word \"was\" is outside a named entity, and so on. So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.\n","\n","So if you want to train a deep learning model for NER, it requires that you have your data in this IOB format (or similar formats such as [BILOU](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17116446/what-do-the-bilou-tags-mean-in-named-entity-recognition)). There exist many annotation tools which let you create these kind of annotations automatically (such as Spacy's [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), [Tagtog](https://docs.tagtog.net/) or [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)). You can also use Spacy's [biluo_tags_from_offsets](https://spacy.io/api/goldparse#biluo_tags_from_offsets) function to convert annotations at the character level to IOB format.\n","\n","Here, we will use a NER dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/namanj27/ner-dataset) that is already in IOB format.

a sanity check, which I learned thanks to Andrej Karpathy's wonderful [cs231n course](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) at Stanford (see also his [blog post about debugging neural networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)). The initial loss of your model should be close to -ln(1/number of classes) = -ln(1/17) = 2.83. \n","\n","Why? Because we are using cross entropy loss. The cross entropy loss is defined as -ln(probability score of the model for the correct class). In the beginning, the weights are random, so the probability distribution for all of the classes for a given token will be uniform, meaning that the probability for the correct class will be near 1/17. The loss for a given token will thus be -ln(1/17). As PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) (which is used by `BertForTokenClassification`) uses *mean reduction* by default, it will compute the mean loss for each of the tokens in the sequence (in other words, for all of the 512 tokens). The mean of 512 times -log(1/17) is, you guessed it, -log(1/17).  \n","\n","Let's verify this:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eqAN7YVIjKTr","outputId":"bb71c855-558b-4f27-aa1b-c02f8503fb39","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1639710834074,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":163,"user":{"displayName":"Cristóvão Iglesias","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjZm3oyybYQWq_ZX-_JuJdw5OSvA5vjlcu4genoWw=s64","userId":"11481490160440964972"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["tensor(1.4075, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=<NllLossBackward0>)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":76}],"source":["ids = training_set[0][\"ids\"].unsqueeze(0)\n","mask = training_set[0][\"mask\"].unsqueeze(0)\n","targets = training_set[0][\"targets\"].unsqueeze(0)\n","ids = ids.to(device)\n","mask = mask.to(device)\n","targets = targets.to(device)\n","outputs = model(input_ids=ids, attention_mask=mask, labels=targets)\n","initial_loss = outputs[0]\n","initial_loss"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yLdwsru9Mh7U"},"source":["This looks good.
