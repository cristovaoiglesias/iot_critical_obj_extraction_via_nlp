The preliminary hardware suite consists of a microcontroller, a pump, a motor-control subsystem, and a limited user interface.
The microcontroller remaps the upper range of data to the maximum digital values, thereby enhancing image brightness at the high end of the pixel value range.
These dynamics require a high degree of flexibility from the chosen microcontroller architecture.
The DM1800 Module is based on RFM's TR3000 Virtual Wire transceiver radio and a PIC 16F688 Flash microcontroller from Microchip Technology.
There are several microcontroller architectures and there are dozens of manufacturers for these as well.
With a small memory footprint and an affordable licensing model, the IAR PowerPac RTOS is particularly aimed at the low-cost ARM-powered microcontroller market.
The DSPnano Operating System offers an ultra tiny embedded POSIX environment for 8 and 16 bit microcontroller based development that is also Linux compatible.
The Unison Operating System offers an ultra tiny embedded POSIX environment for 32 bit microcontroller based development that is also Linux compatible.
