My materials included an arduino Uno, an arduino Ethernet shield, a bunch of 10mm diffused white LEDs and a box kindly donated by National Journal graphic artist Libby Isenstein.
These guys hooked up an air freshener to a Twitter account via an arduino controller.
With an arduino uno, 4 AA batteries and 128 LEDs. I always wanted a playable Tshirt, well now I made one myself.
With a simple arduino board, heart or respiratory rate can be tracked in a player.
The arduino is a type of open source hardware that we covered in The Atlantic in January.
"This is going to be interesting. We are going to assemble a finger to a small servo for testing it with an arduino board."   2.
Last year, I bought an arduino, a small computer about the size of a deck of cards.
the evolution of arduino controls, which allow designers to add sophisticated electronic functions without doing all the coding themselves.
Then load instructions into the arduino's processor via the personal computer," William Gurstelle explained.
The team has tested the arduino at night, under the moonlight, to make sure it can pick up the faint luminosity.
"Using an arduino is fairly straightforward: buy a board (ranging from about $19 to $65) and attach it to a personal computer via a cable.
First developed in Italy in 2005, the arduino (and successors such as the Raspberry Pi) have brought what I like to call "disposable computing" to the masses.
And none of this mentions all the actual work you can do with tiny motors and actuators hooked through the open-source arduino platform.
But it's great as a training task for those familiarizing themselves with the open-source microprocessor, arduino, which has become popular among physical computing enthusiasts.
Within weeks, we got a glimpse of Siri's capabilities when an ad agency rigged her to open a can of beer and another hacked her to unlock a door, using arduino technology.
With applications like Flipboard, Instapaper or Foursquare not to mention new tech like arduino or Botanicals, these streams talk to pages, apps, devices and who knows what else.
For the more absent minded, using the same arduino technology, Laan Labs, which develops apps for smartphones, outfitted Siri to unlock a door.
Allyson Bieryla, an astronomy lab and telescope manager at Harvard, will operate the arduino from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, inside the path of totality.
The endgame of this series of classes—after circuit-board soldering, computer-aided-design instruction, arduino programming, 3-D printing, and more—was robots, always a favorite.
Built around the open-source arduino control board, the collars include a GPS unit and an off-the-shelf cellular modem that can make calls, send SMS, or use a mobile-data network.
"Once programmed, the arduino makes decisions based on the information transmitted by whatever sensors you've hooked up, and does something corporeal, such as turn on or off the motors, displays, valves, and lights attached to it." Now, there's a movie coming out about its development and impact.
The car is outfitted with an arduino device that filters the @Biribot account for the term "pour." After asking Siri to pour a beer with the command "text tweet Beeri," she texts "pour" to the Twitter account, which gets the car going.
Within weeks, we got a glimpse of Siri's capabilities when an ad agency rigged her to open a can of beer and another hacked her to unlock a door, using arduino technology. Since then, developer Pete Lamonica has provided a new platform for others looking to extend Siri's abilities, developing Siri Proxy, a server that can be used to connect the iPhone command system to other objects.
Bratton, “Austin was investigating how new processes affected various properties of cast iron.” His project there was titled:  “Novel Process for Observing Phase Transformations in and Strengthening Cast Iron via Controlled Cooling." The project Austin demonstrates here  here is his arduino LED Cube, which he built from available online supplies and designs and then programmed to appear to shoot fireworks.
