The feasibility of using three types of semiconductor gas sensors to detect the metabolic gas generated by termites was investigated.
Examples from Classical Literature
gas sensors are the devices that transform partial pressures or gas compositions measured in air or gases into an electric signal.
gas sensors try to take advantage of one of the characteristic properties of nanotubes: their electrical conductivity depends on the gas with which they are in contact. 
Most optical gas sensors are passive, relying on the inherent spectroscopic properties of the gases themselves.
The table below provides the cross-sensitivity response of the PHD6 electrochemical toxic gas sensors to common interference gases.
The aim is to develop highly sensitive gas sensors, for monitoring road vehicle emissions, for example, or for providing laboratory staff and mine workers with an early warning of the presence of poisonous substances.
